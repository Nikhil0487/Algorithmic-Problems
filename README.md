# Algorithmic Problems Solved In Swift
Swift solutions to algorithmic problems

I want to try Swift to solve algorithmic problems. I felt this is a great way to dive into 
Swift Standard Library.

While solving problems in Swift if I come across issues/improvements in Swift compiler,
I have raised them [here](bugs.swift.org)

Bugs raised by me so far: 2
I am using sourcekit-lsp in VSCode for Swift language support.
