# Algorithmic Problems Solved In Rust And Swift
Swift solutions to algorithmic problems

I want to try Rust and Swift to solve algorithmic problems. I felt this is a great way to dive into 
Rust and Swift Standard Library.


While solving problems in Swift if I come across issues/improvements in Swift compiler,
I have reported them [here](https://bugs.swift.org/) and I am fixing them as well if possible with 
the support from Swift open source community.

Issues raised by me so far: 5

1. [SR-13100](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13100)
2. [SR-13145](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13145)
3. [SR-13256](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13256)
4. [SR-13313](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13313)
5. [SR-13385](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13385)

I am using sourcekitd for Swift and rust-analyzer for Rust in VSCode on macOS.
All algorithms/problems used/solved are tested on Linux as well.
